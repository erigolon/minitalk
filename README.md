## Description

**Minitalk** is a project at 42 School that involves implementing a communication protocol between two programs using only two signals: **SIGUSR1** and **SIGUSR2**.

The goal of the project is to create a client-server architecture where the client sends a message to the server, and the server displays the message on its standard output.

The communication protocol involves **encoding and decoding messages** using a binary protocol, where each character is represented by 8 bits.

The project requires the use of **Unix signals, signal handlers, and bitwise operations**.

The project is designed to test the student's understanding of **low-level system programming** and their ability to create efficient communication protocols.

## Usage

``make`` to compile all the functions.

``make bonus`` to compile with bonuses.
